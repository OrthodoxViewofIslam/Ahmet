I (keeping my identity anonymous), am a Reader in the Orthodox Church. I am currently going through personal struggles and I am writing this despite my sinfulness. While I am Struggling with my faith, I know that if God hears my prayers he cannot be Allah, and Christ must be the Divine Messiah. My goal is the following;

1. Equip Orthodox laymen with information about Islam in order to better understand Islam. I cannot stop you from leaving the faith, but I hope that you will at least have all of the most relevant information. If your search is for Truth, I sincerely believe it cannot be Islam. I have no reason to lie to you or myself. My time in this realm will end.

2. Equip Orthodox clergy to better understand this religion which has been so intimately intwinned historically with Orthodoxy. I hope it helps you better deal with questions that concern Islam, Muslim converts or the struggles of your parishioners and community.

3. To minister (in whatever way I can) to Muslims. If you are a Muslim reading this it might be surprising to know that I work and interact with a lot of Muslims on my day to day life. I have colleagues whom I respect and care for. Just as you would want my salvation if you liked me, I think the majority of Muslims are people I would want to have your life improve. What better way to make your life better than the Truth? If you don't care for truth, I cannot judge you. I understand conversion can be a burden. I also know that you were taught to believe that I am Dar Al Haram. I exist on this world to test your loyalty to Allah. I (like Abu Lahab) am destined to eternal punishment. Whether you believe it or not, I am not *purposefully* trying to damn you. I genuinely believe that I am speaking of the truth. I have prayed and searched for what is true in this regard. Are you certain your Fitra is illumined and mine is under the influence of Shaytan? Even though the Christian life is hard, at least I dont feel a nagging in my heart that comes when one ignores what their heart already knows.

Al Masih Qom! May God help us all!
